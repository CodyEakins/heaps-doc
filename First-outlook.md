# First outlook

What's next after installation and the *Hello World!* samples?

## Learning materials

Things you should try out.

### Github samples

Besides the [samples you can run online on the Heaps site](https://heaps.io/samples/) you should try the many [**samples from the github repository**](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps/#samples). There are many samples that haven't yet been added to the site of Heaps. The samples are already in your Haxe's Heaps folder on your local machine: `HaxeToolkit\haxe\lib\heaps\git\samples`. When compiling the `all.hxml` file all samples should get compiled (which currently takes about 227 MB of disk space).

Sidenote (Windows): When using HashLink you can run them very quickly when [adding HashLink to your right mouse menues](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/wiki/Further-Tips#working-on-windows).

### Wiki/Docs

- We have many code samples and explanations on our **documentation/wiki pages** here. Have a look at all the sections. (Also compare to the [wiki pages on github](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps/wiki)...)

## Samples from other users

- You can also learn from external public repositories from other **members of the community**

### Discover Haxe

- [Browse **Haxe libraries**](https://lib.haxe.org/) and benefit of the full potential of available Haxe libraries
- Becoming proficient in **Haxe** will provide you with completely new ***abilities and powers*** in your code, therefore it is hugely recommended to have a glance at what Haxe has to offer as a language. These are just some examples (for more [visit Haxe.org](https://haxe.org/)):
  - the [Haxe manual](https://haxe.org/manual/)
  - the [Haxe API](api.haxe.org/)
  - the [Haxe code cookbook](https://code.haxe.org/)
  - the [Haxe community](http://community.haxe.org/) (also visit haxe.org and see "Connect" options)
