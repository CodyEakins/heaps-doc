# First outlook

What's next after installation and the *Hello World!* samples?

Things you should try out:
- Besides the [samples you can run online on the Heaps site](https://heaps.io/samples/) you should try the many [**samples from the github repository**](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps/#samples). There are many samples that haven't yet been added to the site of Heaps. The samples are already in your Haxe's Heaps folder on your local machine: `HaxeToolkit\haxe\lib\heaps\git\samples`. When compiling the `all.hxml` file all samples should get compiled (which currently takes about 227 MB of disk space).
  - Sidenote (Windows): When using HashLink you can run them very quickly when [adding HashLink to your right mouse menues](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/wiki/Further-Tips#working-on-windows).
- We have many code samples and explanations on our **documentation/wiki pages** here. Have a look at all the sections. (Also compare to the [wiki pages on github](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps/wiki)...)
- You can also learn from external public repositories from other **members of the community**
